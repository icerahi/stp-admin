### Why is CHI an important topic?  
3  
### Why is it so hard?  

---

## The Goal of HCI – Usability  
4  
People are trying to accomplish their personal tasks in life. (system independent)  
- **Task**  
- **System**  
Introduce a system.  
User Interface should maximize their ability.

- **Environment**  
- **Task**  
- **Person**  
- **System**  

---

## User-Centered Design  
6  
- **Design**  
- **Evaluate**  
- **Develop**  

---

## Definition of HCI  
7  
Human-computer interaction is a discipline concerned with:  
- The design,  
- Evaluation, and  
- Implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them.  

---

## ACM Model  
8  

---

## Person  
9  
- How persons think and make decisions?  
- Ergonomics  
- Anthropometric and physical characteristics of people  
- User (from an informatics point of view)  
- Having enough computer knowledge  
- Curious and ready for continuous improvement  
- Forgiving design flaws  
- Young and healthy  
- And really how is it?  

---

## Moore’s Law  
10  
- **Price goes down**  
- **Computer capabilities**  
  - Size decreases  
  - Power is growing  
- **Human Opportunities**  
1950 – 1990 – 2030  

---

## User-Centered Design  
11  
- People's tasks, objectives are the basis of design  
- Working with users during development  
- Design solutions are evaluated from the user's perspective  
- Keep in mind people's abilities and the situation in which interaction takes place  
- Communicate with real experts  

---

## Why is CHI an Important Topic?  
12  
- The user expects some system behavior... and they don’t get  
- Impact of the interface on the decision to buy: 80%  
- Time to create interface: about 15%  
- Obvious discrepancy?  
- About 70% of the code serves the interaction  

---

## Why is it so Hard?  
13  
- People (users) are all different  
- Design skill isn’t enough  
- Evaluation with users is required  
- Designer’s pride  
- A variety of technologies

## Why Focus on Usability Increases?  
58  
The Essential Reason - Internet.  
In detail - 5 reasons  

---

## 1/5 – Public on a Global Scale  
59  
- Wider circle of potential users.  
- We don't know who will visit the site and when.  
- Encourages more interest in costs and benefits of usability engineering methods.  

---

## 2/5 – It's Easy  
60  
- More convenient and simpler development tools.  
- No need to be a great specialist to create a website or web application.  
- More unskilled people are doing this.  
- More efforts are needed to do well.  

---

## 3/5 – Quickly Developing  
61  
- Website per hour.  
- Then, it is even more important to use better usability solutions.  
- How many sales are lost in a fast-designed system?  
- Continuous measurements provide an opportunity to improve the interface.  

---

## 4/5 – No Longer Triggers "Let's Start, Then Improve"  
62  
**Software before the Internet appears:**  
1. Somehow released version 1.0. Someone buys.  
2. Version 2.0 already has greater functionality, better tested.  
3. Version 3.0 is expected to be stable and usable.  
**Why did it work?**  
- Customer perception of how it works.  
- Less competition.  

63  
**On the Internet:**  
- The customer will be disappointed once - he will never visit again.  
- The first impression is particularly important. No second chance.  

---

## 5/5 – Usability Myths  
64  
**Myth #1:** Usability - this is self-evident.  
- Why then, so many failed sites?  

**Myth #2:** Good wishes and fair attitude towards the client are enough.  
- Methods, knowledge, skills.  

65  
**Myth #3:** Pressing to become certified  
- Certification is not a panacea.  
- Official certificates are just a few and not widely recognized.  
- Take care not of certificates, but of competence.

## Trends  
66  
- Portability  
- New Information Presentation Technology  
- Home Appliances + New Features  

---

## Examples  
67  
- Apps used as interactive tools for sales, education, healthcare...  
  - Integration with QR codes  
  - Remote app tools  
  - NFC (Near Field Communication)
