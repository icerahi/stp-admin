## Envisionment

## Analysis of the interaction with the system

* Envisionment is concerned with making ideas visible; with eternalizing thoughts.
* Envisionment techniques:

  * Scenarios
  * Storyboards
  * Hierarchical task analysis
  * UML diagrams

## Interface design and usability engineering (Soul Greenberg)

Articulate: Brainstorm → Refined → Completed

* Who users are
* Goals: their key tasks
* Task centered system design
* Graphical screen design
* Psychology of everyday interaction
* Participatory design
* Evaluate usability
* Field testing
* Participatory involvement
* Methods:

  * Task scenario
  * Style guides & metaphors
  * Heuristic evaluation
* User-centered design
* User walk-through
* High fidelity prototyping methods
* Low fidelity prototyping methods
* Throw-away paper prototypes
* User task descriptions
* Testable specification
* Alpha/beta products or complete systems

## Herbert A. Simon about Behavior

* Behavior depends on the environment
* Complex environment requires complex behavior
* The environment will change – behavior will change too
* The purpose of the project is to change the current situation to the desired

## Start of interoperability design

* Most common start error:

  * Immediately thinking about the interface without getting into the user's operation circumstances
  * Then a non-explicit task analysis is performed in the design, that is,
  * No deep understanding of the problem, trying immediately to create a solution

---

## Task analysis

* Explicit task analysis is

  * Conceptual basis of the project
  * Relation with the real situation
  * Based on communication with stakeholders
  * The first is to understand the circumstances of the tasks
  * Next, offer solutions

---

## Task analysis results

* What steps should the user achieve the goal?
* What information or tools do you need in each step?
* What is the purpose of the activity and how is the success of the activity measured?
* One step may be complicated, the other may have untapped opportunities

---

## An example of task analysis

* Start to drive the car
* Unlock the driver's door
* Sit behind the wheel
* Put the key on the ignition switch
* Turn the key to the anti-clockwise direction
* When the engine starts, release the key
* Artifacts:

  * Keys, car’s door, ignition switch

## Product targets

Wireframe and Mockup

---

## Project solutions

---

## Mockup - limited realization

* Helps to test
* Design: How could this look?
* Realization: How could it work?
* Feel: Is it nice to use?

---

## Mockup - limited realization

* Context
* Allows you to know the subject area
* Allows for business communication
* Cheap development and modification
* Designed to refine needs and requirements

---

## Design documentation in the life cycle of the project

* Accuracy
* High-fidelity prototype
* Interactive Mockup
* Layout on paper
* Storyboarding
* Progress of the project

## Type of Design documentation

1. Envisionment techniques — Interaction with the system mockups
2. Interface mockups:

   * Paper prototypes
   * Wireframes
   * Interactive Mockups
3. Mood boards

## Analysis of the interaction with the system

Envisionment techniques:

* Scenarios
* Storyboarding
* Wizards of Oz experiment
* Interaction imitation
* Hierarchical task analysis
* Conceptual modeling of the subject area
* UML diagrams
* Navigation maps

---

## Task Scenarios

* From where lent this idea?
* From cinematography
* Scenarios of the most important events
* Without going into detail
* Highlighting critical moments

| User action | System response |

## Scenario example

* I want to find a book by Laura Esquivel
* I do not remember her name, but I know that it was released in 2003
* I go to the library, open folder in computer and I enter the username and password
* I do not understand why I have to do this because I've already gone through the firewall
* When the password is approved, I can choose:

  * search by author or by year of publication, but I cannot select both search fields together

---

## Scenario (continued)

* I choose a search by author, since the searches for the year provide many books
* After 30 seconds, the directory replies that the author's books are not found and displays many books with a similar name to the author
* After reading the list, I understand that I wrote the author's name incorrectly
* Then I select the desired book and the system shows where it is

---

## Storyboards

* Graphical user sequence of actions
* Show sequence of actions
* Motivation
* Who is involved
* Where activities are going
* What artifacts help the actor carry out activities
* Success criteria

---

## Storyboards

The purpose is to provide an idea of interaction, rather than draw a beautiful picture

## What's present in Storyboards?

* Context of the activities
* Who is involved
* The environment
* Executed tasks
* The sequence of activities
* Motivation
* What steps do you have?
* What's the benefit?
* What helps to carry out?
* Why exactly this action is?
* What are the success criteria?
* What is happening right now?
* What features should you have?

---

## Advantages of the Storyboarding

* Not linked to a specific interface
* Suitable for matching product aim with stakeholder groups
* The temptation to improve drawings protects time constraints, for example 10 minutes

---

## Wizards of Oz prototyping

* Simulates the system without coding
* Wizards of Oz, Jeff Kelly, 1980, doctoral dissertation
* The user sees the mockup of the interface, presses the button...

If you'd like, I can keep going with the rest or help format diagrams, tables, or videos better. Just say!
