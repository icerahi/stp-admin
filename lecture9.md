  - Who are the intended users?

---

## Website Design (2)  
10  
Applicable general principles of designing information architecture:  
- Navigation shows site structure  
- Users should know:  
  - Where am I?  
  - Where can I go?  
  - Where have I been?  
  - What else can be found here?  
- Sites grow and become difficult to navigate over time  

---

## Website Design (3)  
11  
Applicable usability design recommendations (Lecture 8):  
- **Consistency**: e.g., in representing links  
- **Feedback**: e.g., meaningful addresses, understandable names, clear link to home page  

---

## Information Architecture (IA)  
14  
- Focuses on organizing, structuring, and labeling content effectively  
- Goal: Help users find information and complete tasks  
- Integrates organization systems, labeling, search, and navigation  

---

## IA Components  
20  
Main 4 components:  
1. **Organization Structures**: How content is categorized (e.g., by subject or chronology)  
2. **Navigation Systems**: How users browse (e.g., hierarchical menus)  
3. **Search Systems**: How users search (e.g., search queries)  
4. **Labeling Systems**: How information is represented (terminology used)  

---

## Alternative IA Components  
22  
- **Browsing Aids**:  
  - Organization systems  
  - Site-wide/local navigation  
  - Sitemaps/indices/guides  
- **Search Aids**:  
  - Search interfaces  
  - Query languages/builders  
  - Retrieval algorithms  
- **Content & Tasks**: Headings, links, metadata  
- **Invisible Components**: Controlled vocabularies, retrieval algorithms  

---

## Organization Schemes  
27  
- **Exact Intuitive Schemes**:  
  - Alphabetical  
  - Chronological  
  - Geographical  
- **Subjective Schemes**:  
  - Topic-based  
  - Task-based  
  - Audience-based  

---

## Screen Real Estate  
33  
- Content should occupy â‰¥50% of design space  
- Empty space is important  
- Simplicity wins  

Examples:  
- www.delfi.lt: 68% content  
- www.google.com: 45% content  
- www.chess.lt: 60% content  
- www.lrs.lt: 65% content  
- www.bega.lt: Only 25% informative content
