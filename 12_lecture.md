### **Definition: App’s Life Cycle**  
1. **Discovery**  
   - Work  
   - Colleagues  
   - Conversation during work  
   - Family  
   - Parents  
   - Dad and Mom dialogue.  
   - Parents' interactions with other families. (Friends)  
   - Children  
   - Brother and sister dialogue.  
   - Dialogues of children from different families on the Internet, in various live communication. (Friends)  

   **Reasons for downloading the app:**  
   - Recommendations  
   - Attractiveness / interest  
   - Identification of well-known goods or brand name  
   - Discount with app  

2. **Adoption**  
   - Problems are already in the past  
   - Maybe the internet?  
   - Maybe lack of memory?  

3. **Trial**  
   - Good ratings and recommendations are not indicator to a new user.  
   - Users experienced a quick success or failure.  

4. **Abandonment or long-term usage**  
   - Both cases are very valuable  
   - An analysis is required

### **Mobile Technology Objectives**  
1. **Efficiency**  
   - Every laptop device like a human copy.  
   - Present to the user relevant information (success)  
   - General information every time you run the app (failure)  
   - No matter where and when!  
   - Helper in everyday life  
   - Personal assistants, trainers, teachers, motivators, etc.  
   - Innovations  
   - New experiences, skills, acquaintances  

2. **Use of sensors**  
   - Most smartphones have the main sensors:  
     - Radio receiver  
     - Microphone  
     - Etc.  
   - Only about 30-40% of smartphones have:  
     - Accelerometer sensors  
     - Compass  
     - Gyroscopes  
     - Optical sensors  
     - Touch sensors  
     - Cameras with higher resolutions  

   **Challenges:**  
   - The app’s are not capable of processing with each sensor's data.  
   - Sensors are hard to reach.  
   - No commonality between use of sensors.  
   - NECESSARY standardization!  

3. **Geographical position**  
   - GPIS  
   - Maps  
   - Navigation  
   - The goal is to determine the most accurate place.  
   - Geographic position is also used in other applications.  

4. **Continuous operation**  
   - Many app’s are effective = continuous operation.  
   - Examples: Facebook, Instagram, Vinted, Trafi, Sports tracker  
   - Continuous operation cannot:  
     - Use a lot of device resources  
     - Be bored  
     - To be comprehensive (to be personal)  

5. **Integration with other technologies**  
   - Device management using app’s  
   - Data Scan (QR Codes)  
   - Execution of trade  
   - It's like a personal signature - a tool to open all the gates!  

6. **Social relations**  
   - This is one of the main goals  
   - Do not mix with social networks  
   - Social relationships can be supported:  
     - By correspondence  
     - Sending various documents  
     - While working  
     - Etc.  

7. **Meaningful message**  
   - Example: "Tadas commented on your photo."  
   - The photo where you are was Tado's comment.  
   - Short and meaningful messages are very important.

### **3 Types of Apps**  
1. **Native Apps**  
   - Coded in a specific programming language (e.g., Objective-C for iOS, Java for Android).  
   - Full installation on each device.  
   - Fast performance, multitasking, direct OS communication.  
   - **Pros**: Optimized UX, offline use, full device access.  
   - **Cons**: Platform-specific, expensive, frequent updates.  

2. **Web Apps**  
   - Browser-based (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript).  
   - No installation required.  
   - **Pros**: Cross-platform, lower cost.  
   - **Cons**: Limited functionality, requires internet.  

3. **Hybrid Apps**  
   - Combine native and web features.  
   - **Pros**: App store visibility, reusable code.  
   - **Cons**: Internet needed for updates.  

**Comparison:**  
| Feature            | Native | Web | Hybrid |  
|--------------------|--------|-----|--------|  
| Cross-Platform     | ❌     | ✅  | ✅     |  
| Low-Cost           | ❌     | ✅  | ✅     |  
| Offline Use        | ✅     | ❌  | ✅     |  
| Device Access      | ✅     | ❌  | ✅     |

### **GUI Recommendations**  
1. **Design Principles**  
   - Simplify navigation.  
   - Optimize for speed.  
   - Use standard formats (animation, video, sound).  
   - Define scrolling in one direction.  

2. **Touch Controls**  
   - Minimum tap area: 29x44 pixels ("fat finger" rule).  

3. **Content Formatting**  
   - Text: ≥11pt font, high contrast.  
   - Images: High resolution (@2x, @3x).  
   - Avoid distortion (maintain aspect ratios).  

4. **Layout**  
   - Align text/images to show relationships.  
   - Keep controls close to their content.  

**Tools:**  
- Balsamiq Mockups, Appery.io.

### **Future Trends**  
- Expansion into trade, education, healthcare.  
- QR code/NFC integration.  
- Remote control tools.
