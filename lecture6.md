# Lecture 6: Human-Computer Interface Design

## Content / Aims

* Requirements perception
* Requirements generation methods

---

## 1. Requirements Perception

* Includes:

  * Requirements collection
  * Requirements generation
* Use of templates in bigger projects
* Requirements are:

  * Numbered
  * Written in one sentence
* Include:

  * Source
  * Foundation
  * Success criteria and measures
  * Importance level
  * Dependencies or conflicts with other requirements
  * History of changes

---

## 2. Types of Requirements

* **Functional Requirements:**
  What the system should do (e.g., product functions)
* **Non-functional Requirements:**
  How the system should work (e.g., product properties)
* Both types are important for product acceptance

---

## 3. Requirements Prioritization

* **Must have:**
  Essential requirements without which the product is useless
* **Should have:**
  Important requirements that improve the product if resources allow
* **Could have:**
  Less important requirements
* **Want to have:**
  Requirements that can wait for later updates

---

## 4. Participative Design (User Involvement)

* Requirements are gathered by communicating with stakeholders through:

  * Interviews
  * Monitoring and recording activities
  * Focus groups and seminars
* The result includes storytelling and conceptual scenarios

---

## 5. Data Collection Tools

* Interviews
* Questionnaires
* Observations
* Combinations of methods

---

## 6. Successful Data Collection

1. Clear goals
2. Good relationships with participants (clear communication, regulation, incentives)
3. Combination of observation, conversations, and document analysis
4. Pilot studies to test methods

---

## 7. Interviews

* Conducted with stakeholders
* Types:

  * Structured (fixed questions)
  * Semi-structured (flexible questions)
* Use scenarios and storytelling
* Participants may think aloud during task performance
* Often done by two people: interviewer and recorder
* Audio recorded and transcribed
* Focus on:

  * Current problems
  * Opportunities for improvement
* Reflect and verify answers

---

## 8. Interview Questions

* Closed questions (Yes/No) for easy analysis
* Open questions for detailed responses
* Avoid:

  * Long, complex questions
  * Jargon and assumptions
* Examples:

  * Which websites do you visit?
  * What do you like or dislike?
  * What features would you like?

---

## 9. Encouraging Valuable Responses

* Ask only necessary questions
* Promise anonymity
* Ensure questionnaires are error-free
* Offer shorter versions for busy participants
* Use incentives (e.g., prepaid envelopes for mail surveys)
