## Core Concepts

### Usability
**Definition (ISO CD 9241-11.3, version 8.8, 1993):**
Usability is the extent to which a specific user can achieve specific goals with:
- Effectiveness (user accessible targets completeness and accuracy)
- Efficiency
- Satisfaction (system use convenience and acceptability) in specific environments.

### Principles of Usability (Donald Norman, 2002)
1. **Visibility**
   - Users must see how different operations are managed
   - Hidden functionality leads to usage problems

2. **Constraints**
   - Must avoid inappropriate choices in specific situations
   - Types:
     - Physical (drive format and size)
     - Logical (inactive actions)
     - Cultural (meaning of colors)

3. **Mapping**
   - Describes relationship between control and action/result
   - Intuitive images require no explanation

4. **Consistency**
   - Similar features should look similar
   - Similar actions should have similar names
   - Should not contradict established norms

5. **Feedback**
   - Shows information about performed actions
   - Important to choose appropriate feedback methods

6. **Affordance**
   - Object's appearance indicates how it should be used
   - Should make interactive elements clear

## Usability Design Rules (Dix, Finlay, Abowd, Beale)

1. **Learnability**
   - Includes: Predictability, Synthesizability, Familiarity, Generalizability, Consistency
   - Consistency across:
     - Single system
     - Platform
     - Work environment
     - Metaphors

2. **Flexibility**
   - Multiplicity of ways users and system exchange information
   - Includes:
     - Dialogue initiative
     - Multithreading
     - Task migratability
     - Substitutivity
     - Customizability

3. **Robustness**
   - Degree of user support
   - Includes:
     - Observability
     - Recoverability
     - System responsiveness
     - Task confirmation

## Accessibility

### Definition
Accessibility refers to designing products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities.

### Key Aspects:
- Physical spaces accessibility (traditional requirement)
- Information spaces accessibility (modern requirement)
- Benefits everyone, not just people with disabilities
- No "average user" exists - must accommodate diverse needs

### Types of Disabilities Affecting Digital Access:
1. **Visual**
   - Blindness
   - Low vision
   - Color blindness

2. **Auditory**
   - Deafness
   - Hard of hearing

3. **Physical**
   - Difficulty moving hands/wrists
   - Limited focus accuracy
   - Low response time

4. **Cognitive/Neurological**
   - Inability to understand visual/auditory input
   - Concentration/memory limitations
   - Intellectual disabilities
   - Epilepsy

### Assistive Technologies:
- Screen readers
- Braille displays
- Screen magnifiers
- Alternative keyboards
- Voice recognition devices
- Motion detectors

### Universal Design Principles:
1. Equitable use
2. Flexibility in use
3. Simple and intuitive
4. Perceptible information
5. Tolerance for error
6. Low physical effort
7. Size and space for approach/use

## Web Accessibility

### Definition
Basic human right ensuring equal web access for people with disabilities, contributing to their independence and full participation in society.

### Web Accessibility Directive (EU 2016/2102):
- Requires public sector websites/apps to meet technical accessibility standards
- Requires accessibility statements
- Requires feedback mechanisms
- Requires regular monitoring

### WCAG 2.0 Guidelines (Four Principles):

1. **Perceivable**
   - Provide text alternatives
   - Provide time-based media alternatives
   - Create adaptable content
   - Make content distinguishable

2. **Operable**
   - Keyboard accessible
   - Provide enough time
   - Avoid seizure-inducing content
   - Provide navigability

3. **Understandable**
   - Make text readable
   - Make operation predictable
   - Provide input assistance

4. **Robust**
   - Maximize compatibility

## Acceptability

### Social Acceptability
- System may be effective but have negative social impact
- Examples: intrusion systems, inclusive computer games

### Practical Acceptability
- Price (flexible acquisition models)
- Compatibility with existing hardware/software
- Reliability (privacy/security compliance)
- Utility (meeting user goals)

## Special User Groups

### Elderly Users
**Challenges:**
- Reduced motor skills
- Reduced perception
- Reduced speed
- Reduced memory
- Varied technology experience

**Solutions:**
- Touch screens
- Larger fonts
- Louder sounds
- Adjustable settings

### Children
**Age-Related Changes:**
- Physical dexterity
- Attention span
- Intelligence
- Varied backgrounds
- Different goals (educational, social, psychological, creative)

**Teenagers:**
- Early adopters of new interfaces
- Require safety features
- Enjoy exploration
- Prefer familiar characters/repetition
- Dislike patronizing comments
