## Content  
### User-Centered Design  
**Aims:**  
- Needs understanding  
- Envisionment  
- Design  
- Evaluation  

## Evolution of the Creation Process  
1. **Phase 1:**  
   - Developers  
   - Publication  
   - Development and testing  

2. **Phase 2:**  
   - Customers initiate  
   - Developers implement  
   - Development and testing  

3. **Phase 3:**  
   - Customers initiate  
   - Developers implement  
   - Quality/Testing  

4. **Phase 4:**  
   - Customers initiate  
   - Designers "package"  
   - Developers implement  
   - Quality/Testing  

5. **Phase 5:**  
   - Customers initiate  
   - Designers design  
   - Developers implement  
   - Quality/Testing  

## User-Centered Design Framework  
1. **Needs understanding**  
2. **Envisionment**  
3. **Design:**  
   - Conceptual design  
   - Physical design  
4. **Evaluation**  

## Key Interactive Aspects (PACT Analysis)  
Four essential aspects of interactive products:  
- **People:** Who benefits?  
- **Activities:** What activities?  
- **Context:** Where does interaction occur?  
- **Technologies:** What are the possibilities/limitations?  

**Aim:**  
- Define functional and non-functional requirements through stakeholder discussions  

## Stakeholder Communication  
### Primary Questions:  
1. Who directly benefits?  
2. Who leads users?  
3. Who receives product output?  
4. Who makes purchasing decisions?  
5. Users of competitors' products?  

### Secondary Considerations:  
- New systems affect organizational personnel  
- Business depends on system success/failure  
- These individuals are called **stakeholders**  

## Stakeholder Categories (Eason, 1987)  
1. **Primary Users:**  
   - Frequent system users  
   - Changes affect their operations directly  

2. **Secondary Users:**  
   - Occasional or indirect users (e.g., decision-makers)  
   - Benefit from organizational access to information  

3. **Tertiary Users:**  
   - Affected by system output without direct use  
   - May need job adaptations  

4. **Acquirers:**  
   - System developers/maintainers  

## Practical Design Challenges  
1. How many user groups to identify?  
2. Which research methods are most effective?  
3. Where to source initial mockup ideas?  
4. How many alternative mockups to create?  
5. What level of mockup detail is appropriate?  
6. How to evaluate mockups?  

## User Involvement Benefits  
- Users suggest improvements based on existing pain points  
- Compromises needed when direct user communication isn't possible  
- Example: Medical system designers consulting senior students when doctors are unavailable  

## Design Evaluation  
- Assess interaction visualizations (scenarios, storyboards, prototypes)  
- Evaluation methods depend on envisionment goals  
- Conducted by experts or expert-user teams  

## Conceptual Design  
- Defines required information and functions  
- Focuses on **"What?"**  
- Techniques:  
  - Entity-relationship diagrams  
  - Use cases  
  - Dataflow diagrams  
  - Class diagrams  
- Example: Website sitemap and navigation structure  

## Physical Design  
- Focuses on **"How?"**  
1. **Operational Design:**  
   - System functionality  
   - Content structure/storage  

2. **Representational Design:**  
   - Aesthetics: colors, shapes, layout  

3. **Interaction Design:**  
   - Action sequences and flow  

## User Types  
### Beginners:  
- Slow, hesitant workflow  
- Need declarative knowledge  
- Require:  
  - Clear feedback  
  - Cancellation options  
  - Contextual help  
  - Minimal choices per screen  

### Advanced Users:  
- Intermittent system use  
- Key needs:  
  - Efficiency  
  - Robustness  
  - Consistency  
  - Task individualization  

### Experts:  
- Master system syntax/semantics  
- Prefer:  
  - Shortcuts  
  - Concise feedback  
  - Customizability  

## User Groups (Personas)  
- Archetypes representing key user segments  
- Capture:  
  - Goals  
  - Behaviors  
  - Pain points  
- Used to:  
  - Guide feature development  
  - Facilitate stakeholder communication  
  - Measure project effectiveness  

## Usability Goals Across Product Lifecycle  
1. **Demonstration:** Core feature showcase  
2. **Purchase:** Easy selection/checkout  
3. **Installation:** Minimal setup time  
4. **Training:** Accessible materials  
5. **Limited Use:** Effective core tasks  
6. **Full Use:** Comprehensive feature adoption  
7. **Limits Assessment:** Performance evaluation  

## Design Methods  
1. **Scenario-Based Design**  
   - Iterative process:  
     - Requirements → Design → Prototype → Evaluate  

2. **Goal-Directed Design (Cooper, 2007)**  
   - Six phases:  
     1. Research  
     2. Modeling  
     3. Requirements  
     4. Framework  
     5. Development  
     6. Support  

## Summary  
User-centered design involves:  
- Stakeholder analysis  
- Usability target formulation  
- Task analysis  
- Mockup creation/evaluation  
- Iterative testing
