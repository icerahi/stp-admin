### User-Centered Design  
1. Implement in the System  
   - Realize  
   - Evaluate  
2. Redesigned  
   - Design  
   - Evaluate  
3. Redesigned  
   - Evaluate  
4. Implement in the System  

### Evaluations  
- **What is evaluated?**  
  - Layouts and Prototypes  
- **When is it evaluated?**  
  - During the project – Formative Assessment  
  - At the end of the project – Summative Evaluation  
- **Why?**  
  - Early detection of usability problems  
  - Problems:  
    - Disturbing activity  
    - Requiring specific knowledge  
    - Distorting the process being measured  
  - Negative feedback  

### Goals  
- Has the activity become:  
  - Faster?  
  - Simpler?  
  - More enjoyable?  
- Does it increase opportunities to make mistakes?  
- Is it clear how to recover from errors?  
- Are all task formulation methods visible?  

### Types of Usability Evaluations  
1. **Empirical** – Includes users in the assessment  
2. **Analytical**  
3. **Formal** – Simulates user behavior and measures  
4. **Expert** – Experts evaluate based on heuristics and experience  
5. **Automatic** – Program evaluates usability based on a model  

### Usability Evaluations  
- **Analytical (Expert) Evaluations**  
  - Participants: Experts  
  - Methods:  
    - Heuristic Evaluation  
    - Cognitive Walkthrough  
    - Activity Analysis  
- **Empirical Tests**  
  - Participants: Users, Experts, Observers (e.g., Programmers)  
  - Methods:  
    - Think-Aloud  
    - Observations  
    - Surveys  

### Heuristic Evaluation: What is it?  
- Evaluates how the interface meets usability principles.  
- Usability principles applied for testing are called **Usability Heuristics**.  

### Expert Reviews  
- **Basis:**  
  - Cognitive psychology models **or**  
  - Usability Heuristics  
- Applied from the start of the project.  
- No detailed layout required (saves time).  
- Conducted by:  
  - Usability Experts **or**  
  - Interface Architects  
- Finds defects not always revealed by user testing.  
- Identifies consistency and flexibility issues.  

### How Many Experts?  
- 3-5 evaluators recommended for optimal defect detection.  

### Quality-to-Price Ratio  
- Cost-effective method for identifying usability issues early.  

### Usability Heuristics  
- **Options:**  
  - Nielsen Heuristics (10)  
  - Norman Rules (4) – From *"Design of Everyday Things"*  
  - Tognazzini Heuristics (16) – [AskTog](http://www.asktog.com/basics/firstPrinciples.html)  
  - Shneiderman’s "Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design" – From *"Designing the User Interface"*  

### Nielsen Heuristics  
- Jakob Nielsen, Rolf Molich (Nielsen Norman Group)  
- Refined from 249 interface defects (1990: 9 heuristics → 1999: 10 heuristics)  

### 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design  
1. **Visibility of System Status**  
2. **Match Between System and the Real World**  
3. **User Control and Freedom**  
4. **Consistency and Standards**  
5. **Error Prevention**  
6. **Recognition Rather Than Recall**  
7. **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**  
8. **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**  
9. **Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors**  
10. **Help and Documentation**  

### Detailed Heuristics  

#### 1. Visibility of System Status  
- Show system status (time, space, changes, actions, next steps, completion).  
- Example: Progress bars, confirmation messages.  

#### 2. Match Between System and the Real World  
- Use familiar metaphors and language.  
- Avoid jargon.  

#### 3. User Control and Freedom  
- Allow undo/redo, cancel, and exit options.  
- Example: Clear navigation paths.  

#### 4. Consistency and Standards  
- Follow platform conventions (e.g., Ctrl+S for save).  

#### 5. Error Prevention  
- Prevent errors with constraints and confirmations.  

#### 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall  
- Minimize memory load (e.g., dropdown menus instead of recall).  

#### 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use  
- Cater to both novices and experts (e.g., shortcuts).  

#### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design  
- Avoid unnecessary information.  

#### 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors  
- Use plain-language error messages with solutions.  

#### 10. Help and Documentation  
- Provide contextual help and examples.  

### Organization of Heuristic Evaluation  
- **Methodology:**  
  - 3-5 evaluators (usability experts).  
  - Individual checks (1-1.5 hours), then group discussion.  
  - Detects ~35% of defects per evaluator; ~75% with 5 evaluators.  
- **Stages:**  
  1. **Instruction:** Introduce tasks and system.  
  2. **Evaluation:** Perform tasks (2 hours max).  
  3. **Reporting:** Discuss findings and prepare report.  

### Heuristic Evaluation Report Structure  
1. **Executive Summary**  
   - Methodology, key conclusions, defects.  
2. **Assessment Environment**  
   - Evaluator demographics, tools used.  
3. **Positive Aspects**  
4. **Major Problems**  
5. **List of Deficiencies** (with screenshots)  
6. **Sources**  

### Defect Severity Scale  
- **4:** Critical (system failure)  
- **3:** Serious  
- **2:** Minor  
- **1:** Cosmetic  
- **0:** No issue  

### Pros and Cons of Heuristic Evaluation  
- **Pros:**  
  - Low cost, early-stage applicability.  
- **Cons:**  
  - Requires expert knowledge.  
  - Highlights problems, not solutions.  
  - May miss critical issues.
